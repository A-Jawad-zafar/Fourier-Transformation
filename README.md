Fourier Transformation of a Cosine Pulse

# Fourier Transformation of a Cosine Pulse
This project performs the Fourier transformation of a cosine pulse to analyze and visualize the frequency components of the pulse. The Fourier transformation is executed using MATLAB's built-in FFT function and through numerical integration of Fourier transformation's mathematical equation.

# Objective
The main goal of this project is to provide insights into the Fourier transformation of analytical expressions and to compare the efficiency and accuracy of different methods.

# Description
The script defines a cosine pulse based on given parameters and plots it. It then performs the Fourier transformation using two different methods:

MATLAB's built-in FFT function
Numerical integration
The frequency spectrum obtained from both methods is plotted for analysis and comparison.

# Files
Fourier.m: MATLAB script file containing the implementation of the Fourier transformation methods and plotting.

# Prerequisites
MATLAB

# Usage
1- Clone the repository or download the Fourier.m file.
2- Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the Fourier.m file.
3- Run the Fourier.m script in MATLAB.

# Implementation Details
The time vector is defined from -1000 to 1000 with 10000 points.
The parameters of the cosine pulse, such as amplitude, duration, and frequency, are specified in the script.
The original cosine pulse is plotted first.
The Fourier transformation is performed using MATLAB's built-in FFT function, and the resulting frequency spectrum is plotted.
The Fourier transformation is also performed using numerical integration over a specified frequency range, and the resulting frequency spectrum is plotted.
The plots are designed to provide clear insights into the frequency components of the original cosine pulse.

# Visualization
The script provides three plots:

The original cosine pulse in the time domain.
The frequency spectrum was obtained using MATLAB's built-in FFT function.
The frequency spectrum was obtained using numerical integration.
Each plot includes grid lines, labels, and titles for better understanding.
